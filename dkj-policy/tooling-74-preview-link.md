### PLAN

Dave (#74): once a subagent finishes a design, the handover always carries a live localhost link. Gwen has
no shell, so the link is made at the handover in the main thread: a script prints the URL Vite actually
serves on, and Chris's lens makes running it part of handing over a visible result.

### CREATE

- [x] Cody: `scripts/preview/start-preview.ps1` -- starts Vite for this checkout in the background,
  reuses a live one it started, reads the link from Vite's own output; `-Lan` adds the phone link, `-Stop`
  stops it.
- [x] Tessa: the handover rule in Chris's lens; one line in the README.

### TEST

- [x] Ran it on this machine: a cold start printed `localhost:5174` (5173 was taken by a hand-started
  server, which is the case the script exists for), and the page answered 200 under the base path; a second
  run reused the server; `-Lan` printed the network link too; `-Stop` took it down.
- [x] Victor's review, all applied but the concurrency race (noted in the header): a PID is only killed when
  its start time matches the one recorded, the state is written as UTF8, a failed start cleans up after
  itself, `-Lan` waits a few seconds for a network link rather than the full timeout, the health check
  bypasses the system proxy, a missing `node` gets its own message. Re-ran: forged state with a reused
  PID left that process alone; switching `-Lan` restarted cleanly; lint clean.
- [x] Edith: no findings beyond one comment made exact.

### DEPLOY: tooling/74-preview-link

When a design is finished, the handover now always ends with a link that works:
`scripts/preview/start-preview.ps1` starts the dev server and prints the address it really runs on
(with `-Lan`, also the address for a phone on the same network). A typed `localhost:5173` could point
at a different server, because Vite moves to the next free port.
